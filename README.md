# licenses
A Repository for Lawyers &amp; Stackholders as also Consumers of my Software Products. 

## General Main License Concept
I integrate every license as needed and redistribute it if it is possible else i resell the needed licenses so that you do not need to worry.

## Open Source [BUSL-1.1](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html) turning into Apache-2.0 | MIT | [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) | Any
In General i use the BUSL for Open Source that means i leave again all existing licenses untouched and my own work gets Licensed under the BUSL
That again changes into a other License on a given date in that BUSL mostly [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) or what ever the original license was.

The BUSL is a Idea from MariaDB and is in general a Way to offer Open Source Software while protecting against all kinds of stealing interlectual Property.

## Questions left?

You will find in all newer Repos a ```licenses``` folder and a LICENSE.txt file that points to the ```licenses``` folder that contains everything
related to the current Software Product. Also every single file may contain additional copyright Information if it not already got transfered to the
```licenses``` folder.
