# licenses
A Repository for lawyers &amp; Stackholders as also Consumers of my Software Products. 

## General Main License Concept
I integrate every license as needed and redistribute it if it is possible else i resell the needed licenses so that you do not need to worry.

## Open Source BSL + Apache-2.0 | MIT | Any
In General i use the BSL for Open Source that means i leave again all existing licenses untouched and my own work gets Licensed under the BSL
That again changes into a other License on a given date in that BSL.

The BSL is a Idea from MariaDB and is in general a Way to offer OpenSource while protecting against all kinds of stealing interlectual Property.

## Questions left?

You will find in all newer Repos a ```licenses``` folder and a LICENSE.txt file that points to the ```licenses``` folder that contains everything
related to the current Software Product. Also every single file may contain additional copyright Information if it not already got transfered to the
```licenses``` folder.
